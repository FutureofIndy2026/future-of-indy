    <h1>Trust, Safety & Reform: Why Indianapolis Must Repair Police Relations — and Tighten Gun Access to Young People</h1>

    <h2>Indianapolis Faces a Crossroads</h2>
    <p>Indianapolis is a city in motion — growing, evolving, and navigating new challenges. But as the city looks to the future, it finds itself at a crossroads in public safety. Trust between police and communities remains frayed, and easy access to guns for young people continues to fuel violence. Without decisive action the cycle of tragedy will repeat itself.</p>

    <p>In 2024, Marion County recorded more than 200 homicides and thousands of aggravated assaults. Early data from 2025 shows a decline in homicides, a promising trend. Yet many families and community leaders say statistics alone cannot erase years of tension between neighborhoods and law enforcement. For them, building trust is essential — and so is addressing gun laws that allow 18-year-olds to legally carry handguns on city streets.</p>

    <p>Under state law, Indiana is a permitless carry state. Since July 2022, any adult 18 or older who is legally permitted to own a firearm may carry one, openly or concealed, without a license. The state does enforce the “Jake Laird Law,” which allows courts to temporarily remove firearms from individuals who pose an imminent risk. But local leaders have struggled to move further. In 2023, the Indianapolis City-County Council passed a proposal to raise the minimum purchase age to 21 and impose stricter licensing, but the ordinance remains unenforceable under state preemption rules.</p>

    <p>Critics say the gap between local needs and state law puts Indianapolis residents at risk. Advocates argue that raising the age to 21, requiring safety training, and enforcing waiting periods would keep firearms out of the hands of teenagers too young to carry that responsibility. “This isn’t about limiting lawful ownership for responsible adults,” one community leader said. “It’s about stopping dangerous access for those who aren’t ready to handle lethal force.”</p>

    <p>Responsibility, they add, should not stop with teenagers. Too many tragedies have occurred when minors gain access to unsecured firearms at home. While Indiana law prohibits furnishing firearms to minors in many cases, enforcement is inconsistent and penalties are limited. Supporters of reform say parents and guardians should face stricter consequences if their unsecured guns are used in crimes by children. Proposals include tougher criminal penalties, civil liability, and safe-storage requirements.</p>

    <p>Community leaders stress that rebuilding trust between residents and law enforcement must go hand in hand with tighter firearm rules. They argue that police cannot be effective partners if the laws they enforce allow guns to circulate too freely among youth. Stronger guardrails, they say, would ease tensions and reduce the risk of violent encounters.</p>

    <p>Indianapolis cannot police its way to peace, advocates warn. But it can legislate its way toward greater responsibility. With stronger partnerships between neighborhoods and officers, and with common-sense safeguards that make it harder for young people to obtain guns, they believe the city can move toward a safer and more trusting future.</p>
