    <h1>Trust, Safety & Reform: Why Indianapolis Must Repair Police Relations — and Tighten Gun Access to Young People</h1>
    <p>Indianapolis is a city on the move. We’re growing, we’re changing, we’re trying to find our footing in a world that looks very different than it did ten years ago. But one thing hasn’t changed enough — too many people in this city don’t trust the police, and too many young people have easy access to guns. That’s a dangerous combination, and if we don’t address it head-on, we’ll keep repeating the same tragic headlines year after year.</p>

    <p>Last year, Marion County saw more than 200 homicides and thousands of assaults. This year, thankfully, homicides are trending down. That’s encouraging — but let’s be honest: families who have lost loved ones don’t find much comfort in statistics. Progress doesn’t erase the tension between neighbors and law enforcement, and it doesn’t erase the fact that teenagers are still getting their hands on weapons they should never have access to.</p>

    <p>Here’s the truth: we can’t build safer neighborhoods if the people who live in them don’t trust the officers sworn to protect them. And we can’t expect that trust to grow when 18-year-olds can legally carry handguns in Indiana, and when guns are sitting unsecured in too many households.</p>

    <p>That has to change. We need to raise the minimum age to purchase and carry a handgun to 21. We need mandatory training and a real waiting period before anyone can put a weapon on their hip. And we need to hold parents accountable when their kids get access to guns. If a teenager commits a crime with a gun that was sitting in a parent’s dresser drawer, there should be consequences — not just for the teen, but for the adult who failed to lock it up. A firearm in the wrong hands isn’t just a mistake. It’s negligence with life-or-death consequences.</p>

    <p>At the same time, we need to repair the relationship between communities and law enforcement. That means consistent neighborhood patrols where people see the same officers every week, not a rotating cast of strangers. It means real transparency when misconduct happens, so residents know accountability isn’t just a buzzword. And it means investing in youth programs and violence prevention so that we’re addressing the causes of crime, not just reacting after the fact.</p>

    <p>Indianapolis doesn’t need to choose between trust and reform — we need both. Stronger partnerships between neighborhoods and police, and stronger laws that keep guns out of the hands of kids who aren’t ready for them. That’s not an anti-gun stance, it’s a pro-responsibility stance.</p>

    <p>We can’t police our way to peace. But we can legislate, educate, and partner our way to safer streets. Indianapolis families deserve nothing less.</p>
