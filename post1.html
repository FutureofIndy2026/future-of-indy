    <h1>Trust, Safety & Reform: Why Indianapolis Must Repair Police Relations — and Tighten Gun Access to Young People</h1>
    <p>Indianapolis is a city in motion — growing, evolving, navigating challenges. But we face a critical crossroads in public safety: trust between police and communities is frayed, while gun access for youth remains too permissive under current laws. If we don’t act decisively, we risk perpetuating cycles of violence rather than reversing them.</p>

    <p>In 2024, Marion County and Indianapolis faced surging violent crime rates—including hundreds of homicides and thousands of aggravated assaults. Even though early 2025 data shows a decline in homicide counts, those improvements do not erase years of systemic tension between law enforcement and neighborhoods where too many residents don’t feel heard or protected. Repairing relationships must be a priority. But so must limiting firearm access to vulnerable populations, especially young people — because trust alone cannot overcome the danger of a loaded weapon in the hands of a teen without training or oversight.</p>

    <h2>The Legal Landscape in Marion County & Indiana</h2>
    <p>Indiana is a permitless carry state: since July 1, 2022, adults aged 18 or older who are legally allowed to own a firearm may open- or conceal-carry a handgun without a permit. The state enforces the Jake Laird Law, which allows courts to temporarily remove firearms from individuals who pose imminent risk. In Marion County, the City-County Council passed Ordinance Proposal 156 in 2023, aiming to raise the minimum age to 21 for purchases and impose stricter licensing. But due to state preemption, much of the proposal cannot be enforced unless Indiana changes its laws. As it stands, 18-year-olds can legally carry handguns, even as local leaders push for stronger guardrails.</p>

    <h2>Why We Must Raise the Age & Add Red Tape</h2>
    <p>Firearm access among youth directly fuels impulsive violence. Raising the minimum purchase and carry age to 21, requiring mandatory training, and extending waiting periods would reduce the number of guns in the hands of teenagers not ready for that responsibility. This isn’t about restricting lawful ownership for responsible adults — it’s about preventing dangerous access for those too young to handle lethal force.</p>

    <h2>Holding Parents Accountable</h2>
    <p>Just as important is ensuring parents and guardians take responsibility. Too many tragedies occur when minors gain access to unsecured firearms in the home. Indiana law prohibits furnishing firearms to minors in many circumstances, but penalties are limited and enforcement inconsistent. Indianapolis should push for stricter consequences on parents who allow guns to fall unlawfully into their children’s hands. That could mean stronger criminal penalties when minors commit crimes with unsecured household weapons, civil liability for damages, and mandatory safe-storage requirements. A firearm in a dresser drawer is not just a lapse in judgment — it can be the difference between life and death for a child, their peers, or even police officers forced into confrontation.</p>

    <h2>Integrating Both Efforts: Trust + Reform</h2>
    <p>Rebuilding police-community trust and tightening youth firearm access are not competing goals — they are complementary. If police are to be seen as legitimate community partners, they must enforce laws that are fair, consistent, and protect the vulnerable. Stricter rules on youth access to guns and parental accountability send a clear message: firearm ownership is a right, but also a responsibility that extends to families and neighborhoods.</p>

    <p>Indianapolis cannot police its way to peace, but it can legislate its way to responsibility. Trust will follow when the rules are clear, and safety will improve when guns are harder for teenagers to obtain. A stronger future for our city depends on both — strong community-police partnerships and common-sense safeguards that keep firearms out of the wrong hands.</p>
